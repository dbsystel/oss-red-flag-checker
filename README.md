This projects evaluates remote repositories by looking for typical red flags like CLAs (Contributor Licensing Agreements) but also indicators for governance, activity or licensing conditions we consider as good.

### Searched data

The checker looks for the following data in remote repositories:

* CLA (Contributor License Agreement) mentioned in files and pull requests
* DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) mentioned in files and pull requests
* inbound=outbound mentioned in files
* Existence of LICENSE/COPYING file
* Human and bot contributors to the project (based on Github stats)
* Last commits made by humans and bots

### Analysis based on data

Red flags:

* CLA mentioned in `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` files
* CLA as part of pull request actions/statuses
* No `LICENSE`/`COPYING` file in the repository
* The project only contains contributions by one person
* The last commit is more than 1 year old

Yellow flags:

* The project's main developer made more than 75% contributions than the next 10 most active contributors
* The last human commit is more than 1 year old but there have been newer commits made by bots (like dependabot or renovate)
* The last human commit is more than 90 days old

Green flags:
* DCO mentioned in `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` files
* DCO as part of pull request actions/statuses
* inbound = outbound mentioned in `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` files
* The project has an acceptable contribition distribution by multiple active developers
* The last human commit is less than 90 days old


## Installation

You must have the following dependencies installed:

* `git` >= 1.7.0
* `python` >= 3.8
* `pip3`

You can install the latest release using pip: `pip3 install oss-red-flag-checker`.

The command to run the program afterwards will be `ossrfc`.

### Install/develop using poetry

You can also run this tool via `poetry` that takes care of installing the correct dependencies in a clean environment. This also makes development very easy. We recommend to have at least poetry 1.1.0. Inside of the repository, run `poetry install` once and you are ready to go. If you update the repository, run this command again to fetch new versions and dependencies.

The command to run the programm will be `poetry run ossrfc`.

## Usage

You can find all supported flags by running `ossrfc --help`.

> [!NOTE]
> It is recommended to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token to avoid low API rate limits.
> Either use the `--token` argument or set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

Basic examples:

```sh
# Check a remote repository
ossrfc -r https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform
# Cache the cloned repository so subsequent checks are faster
ossrfc -r https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform --cache
# Return the results as JSON
ossrfc -r https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform --json
# Do not check for CLAs and DCOs in pull requests
ossrfc -r https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform -d cla-dco-pulls
# Ignore findings about contribution distribution
ossrfc -r https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform -i contributions
# Provide a list of repositories to be checked
ossrfc -f repos.txt
```

Here's a possible output in both the Markdown view as well as in JSON:

```md
# Report for hashicorp/terraform (https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform)

* ðŸš© Licensing: A mention of Contributor License Agreements in the following file(s): .github/CONTRIBUTING.md
* ðŸš© Licensing: A check for Contributor License Agreements in at least one status in pull request(s): 33656
* âœ” Contributions: The project has multiple contributors with an acceptable contribution distribution
* âœ” Contributions: The last commit made by a human is less than 90 days old (1 days)
```

## Caveats

### Opinionated analysis

The analysis and decisions for how certain indicators are considered red, yellow or green flags is highly opinionated and represents a snapshot about our (DB Systel GmbH's) current thinking.

You are free to use this tool. If certain criteria is not relevant for you, consider using the `--ignore` or `--disable` flags.

In the long run, it may be feasible to make the ratings configurable. Contributions are welcome if you are interested in it.
